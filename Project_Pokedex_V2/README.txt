Hours Worked: 18-20 Hours

Instructions: Please run the "App.java" in order to start the program

Functionality: 
Majority of the core mechanics works
-	Loads Pokémon from a file
-	Display all Pokémon.
-	Display all types.
-	Given the type, display all Pokémon (Name) by that type.
-	Display all Pokémon according to high or lowest stat.
-	Create a team
-	Add a Pokémon to a certain team.
-	Be able to compare two different Pokémon. From there they can see type advantages and stats advantage.
However there were some that I wasn't able to accomplish.
-	Pokemon objects were not able to have movesets and locations. This was due to the information source I was working with. I beleived the information was around, but this meanth I had to spend alot more time digging through the files and figuring out what the numbers meant. But I beleive how I treated the files for Pokemon types (using hash maps), would be the same for moveset and locations
-	Due to the amount of data, not everything is shown whenever all Pokemon is printed.
-	Forms of validation when inputting data to the program, was very limitted.
Therefore, I wasn't able to work on any of my extensions from the proposal.
